> This project was made for the Eduvos EdTech 2022 Hackathon. 

## Description

ScholarSpace came in 3rd place. This application is a hub for students to find internships/vacation-work or part-time jobs related to their qualification of study and for recruiters to find students to hire.

### What can users do?

**Students are able to do the following:**
- Sign-up using their student email.
- Edit account details.
- Create and edit multiple profiles designed for specific jobs.
- Apply for jobs using a profile created and write a cover letter .
- View tips on cv, cover letter writing, language style tips and interview tips as well as other tips.
- Search for jobs on the Discover page.
- Apply filters to job searches. 
- Save jobs. 
- Complete upskilling courses listed, complete a quiz for said course and earn a badge. This is displayed on the users profiles when applying for jobs.
- Chat with recrutiers.
- Write reviews for employers from the app.

**Recruiters are able to do the following:**
- Sign-up using company details and email address.
- Create jobs.
- View and manage jobs according to posted, active and closed. This is sorted according the job status set by recruiters.
- Add applicants to a shortlist.

- Write reviews for students employed.
  
### Technology used

The tools used to build this application are as follows:
- Visual Studio Code
- Angular
- Firebase

Languages used:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML & CSS

The focus of this project is to showcase the frontend of the application, with minimal functionality and retrival of basic information from the database. The biggest struggle in developing this prototype was including all the functionality of the application within the short time frame given. However, the prototype shows the expected design, layout and navigation of the application if it were fully functional.
